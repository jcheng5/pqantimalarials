\title{Estimated under-five deaths associated with poor-quality
  antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa.}
\description{
pqantimalarials provides an interactive webtool that allows
users to produce their own estimates of the number of
under-five deaths associated with poor- quality
antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa according to the
methodology of Renschler et al. (2014). Users can set the
input paramaters and download the results from uncertainty
and sensitivity analyses. pqantimalarials has one function
\code{webtool()} that starts the interactive web tool on
the user's machine. You can follow the development of this
package at:
